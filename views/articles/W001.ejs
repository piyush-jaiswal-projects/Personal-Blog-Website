            As per Wikipedia, Web development is the work involved in developing a Web site for the Internet or an intranet. Web development can range from developing a simple single static page of plain text to complex web applications, electronic businesses, and social network services. But for me, Web Development is an art. The art of developing a beautiful yet easy-to-use website that makes people go wow and spend some time on it.
        </p>
        <p class="articleContent">
            Now the question comes why to learn web development? There are already some software and websites which build a website for free. I had decided to learn web development because it gives you the freedom to create whatever design you like and to customize it as per your preferences. In the modern startup-driven world, every new startup needs a website and hence a web developer. So there is a huge scope of career in web development in future. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <h2 class="articleContentHeading">Web Developemnt</h2>
        <br>
       <p class="articleContent">
        There are two aspects of web development. These are:
       <br>
       <br>
1. <strong>Front end Web Development:</strong> It comprises of what all you can see when you visit a website. It may be, the design, the information, interaction with website. Front end Web development is done with HTML, CSS, one programming language(Javascript, Python, etc) and some frameworks like Bootstrap, jQuery, etc. You can think of it as human body seen from outside. You know we got sense to interact, and the design of our body, and all that.
<br>
<br>
2. <strong>Back-end Web Development:</strong> It comprises what goes on behind the website that makes the particular website perform some functions like signing up, accessing data from databases, etc. So basically it’s more about servers and databases. This is done with the help of a back-end programming language(for example, Node.js), database (MySQL or NoSQL), and some frameworks. You can think of it as the vital organs of the human body which allow it to perform some functions.
<br>
<br>
<strong>Full-stack Web Development:</strong> If you learn both front end and back end, then you will be called a full stack developer. So basically full-stack website development means developing a complete website from scratch. 
      </p> 
      <br>
      <h2 class="articleContentHeading">How did I learn web development?</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="articleContent">
        I started with a course on full-stack web development on Udemy. Why Udemy? Because I think it’s a good course and affordable as well. Here is the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/" class="extLink">link to that course</a>. Now this course itself includes 5-10 good projects for hands-on experience. After going through this course, I started building some projects on my own. I have uploaded some of them on GitHub. Here is the <a href="https://github.com/piyushinfinity?tab=repositories" class="extLink">link</a>. Now I am looking for some freelancing projects to further improve my skill. I use the following technologies to develop websites:
        <br>
        HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Mongoose
      </p>
      <br>
      <p class="articleContent">
        React: These days most websites are developed with the help of React. React is generally used if you have multiple repetitive components in your website. I am still learning about it.
      </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="articleContentHeading">Free Courses:</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="articleContent">
        1. For HTML, CSS, Bootstrap: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe3H6c9OGXb5_6wcc1Mca52n" class="extLink">Apni Kaksha Course</a>. They are currently taking courses for full-stack web development, but they have uploaded lectures for HTML, CSS, Bootstrap only. But they are the best lectures. (Hindi Language)
        <br>
        <br>
        2. Web Development Tutorial by Code With Harry: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agiCUZYRsvtGTXdxkzPyItg" class="extLink">Youtube Playlist</a>

        3. Free course on the back-end by <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-backend--ud171" class="extLink">Udacity</a>
        <br>
        <br>
        4. And there are many free courses on youtube. Just search for it. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=web+development+tutorials" class="extLink">Click here for direct results</a>.
      </p>
      <p class='articleContent'>
        Note: If you want to do only front-end web development or back-end web development, you can go to full-stack web development courses and only do the lectures required for your goal.
      </p>

      <br>
      <h2 class="articleContentHeading">Project ideas for practice:</h2>
      <br>
      <p class="articleContent"> 
        1. For front-end web development: <a href="https://www.frontendmentor.io/" class="extLink">frontendmentor.io</a> is the best website. You will get everything over here to consolidate your knowledge.
       <br>
        2. For back-end web development: You should try to clone existing websites like Amazon, youtube, etc. This will be the best way.
        <br>
        3. You must make full use of <a href="https://github.com/" class="extLink">GitHub</a>. Just search back-end projects or whatever you want to practice, and you will get lots of ideas to build your portfolio.
